add a "menu" subcommand that prompts the user for action

Actions are:
- [g]enerate code from current prompt file contents
- [d]one generating and editing, commit msg = the same prompt used to generate
- [p]rompt file modified, commit msg = current prompt file contents
- [a]bort the menu and do nothing

A single keystroke, without the need to press enter, is enough to trigger the action.
