aidda: cleaner messages when timestamps are out of order

If a subcommand fails because timestamps are out of order, and if
we're in interactive mode, redisplay the menu so the user can try
again, instead of returning an err from Do().

"Interactive mode" is when the user has provided a menu subcommand
in args.

- refactor the for{} loop in Do() such that it consumes (shifts)
  subcommands from args, instead of iterating over them
- only redisplay the menu if we are in interactive mode
- when redisplaying the menu, make this happen by pushing the 'menu'
  subcommand onto the front of the args slice rather than appending it
