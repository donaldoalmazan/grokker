x/tokencount: first draft 

First draft of a tool to count tokens in all files in a directory
tree.  Similar to `ohcount`, and actually uses `ohcount -d` to
identify the languages of the files.

- inventory tree content using `ohcount -d`
- count tokens in each file, totaling by language
    - use code similar to the "tc" subcommand to count tokens
- report totals by language
- report grand total
