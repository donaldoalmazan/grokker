The similarity score between a pair of texts can be calculated using
various techniques:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: This method considers the angle between two
   vectors (formed by text embeddings). If two vectors have the same
   orientation, the cosine similarity is 1. If the vectors are
   orthogonal (at a 90-degree angle to each other), their cosine
   similarity is 0. This method focuses on orientation rather than
   magnitude, making it popular for text analysis.

2. **Euclidean Distance**: This method calculates the "straight-line"
   distance between two vectors. It's more sensitive to magnitude than
   cosine similarity.

3. **Jaccard Similarity**: This technique measures the intersection or
   union of two sets and is useful when your vectors are in binary
   form.

4. **Pearson Correlation**: This calculates the linear relationship
   between two embedding vectors. It measures how much two random
   variables change together.

5. **Spearman Correlation**: This is a non-parametric measure of rank
   correlation that measures statistical dependence between the
   rankings of two variables.

6. **Bidirectional Transformers**: These are deep learning models that
   contextualize word meanings based on surrounding texts. It
   considers both left and right contexts in all layers.

The method to use depends on the problem at hand, and different
metrics have different properties that could be more or less
beneficial depending on the situation.
