don't read new prompt file at init

During aidda init, we create a new, default prompt file but prefix the
first line with a # to prevent it from being used.  We don't want to
read this file at init time.

- refactor NewPrompt(), getPrompt(), and callers
- rename NewPrompt() to mkPrompt()
- don't have mkPrompt() read the prompt file
- don't have getPrompt() call mkPrompt()
- call mkPrompt() from init case, not earlier

In: 
    v3/aidda/aidda.go
Out: 
    v3/aidda/aidda.go
.stop

get rid of "done" subcommand

use language model or embedding to detect significant changes in the
prompt and warn user of skipped commit
