don't read new prompt file at init

During aidda init, we create a new, default prompt file but prefix the
fire list with a # to prevent it from being used.  We don't want to
read this file at init time.

- refactor NewPrompt(), getPrompt(), and callers
- rename NewPrompt() to mkPrompt()
- don't have mkPrompt() read the prompt file
- don't have getPrompt() call mkPrompt()
- call mkPrompt() from init case, not earlier
