Based on the provided code and documentation, to allow overriding the model on the command line for all subcommands without changing the model name stored in `.grok`, you will need to implement command line parsing that can identify and prioritize a model override flag or argument across subcommands. For this, you can use the Kong CLI library, which provides a flexible way to define and parse command line flags and arguments.

Here are the changes required to implement this feature:

1. **Add a Global Model Flag**: Introduce a global flag that specifies the model override. This flag should be accessible by all subcommands and should have higher precedence than the model specified in `.grok`.

2. **Update Subcommand Execution**: Modify the execution flow of subcommands to check if the global model override flag is set and use the specified model instead of the default model from `.grok`.

3. **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that the addition of the global model override flag does not interfere with existing flags and arguments of subcommands.

### Modifications

1. **Define Global Flag**: Add a global `--model-override` flag to the CLI struct.

    ```go
    type CLI struct {
        ModelOverride string `name:"model-override" help:"Override the model for all operations"`
        // Existing fields...
    }
    ```

2. **Utilize Model Override**: Adjust each subcommand implementation to use `ModelOverride` if it's non-empty, prior to executing the command logic that depends on the model.

    ```go
    func (g *Grokker) DoSomething(args ...string) (err error) {
        modelToUse := g.Model  // g.Model is the default model from .grok
        if cli.ModelOverride != "" {
            modelToUse = cli.ModelOverride
        }
        // Use modelToUse for operation...
    }
    ```

3. **Integrate with Kong CLI Parsing**: Ensure the Kong CLI parsing logic initializes and considers the global flag correctly across all invocations.

    ```go
    config := NewCliConfig()
    kong.Parse(&cli,
        kong.Name("yourapp"),
        kong.Description("Your Application Description"),
        kong.Configuration(kong.JSON, "/path/to/.grok"),  // Example path
        kong.Vars{"model": "defaultModel"},  // Set default model value if needed
    )
    ```

4. **Validate and Test**: Thoroughly test the implementation to ensure the model override works as expected across all subcommands.

### Files to be Changed
Given the provided code structure, at minimum, the following files will need modifications:

```
/cli/cli.go
```

This is where the main CLI parsing and subcommands are defined. You'll be integrating the global model override flag here and ensuring all subcommand handlers respect this override.

Ensure to carefully review the integration of the global flag with Kong CLI to maintain compatibility with existing flags and arguments, and adjust command execution flows accordingly.

By following this approach, you should be able to introduce a seamless model override mechanism into the CLI tool, improving its flexibility in handling different models across multiple subcommands without altering the stored default model.
