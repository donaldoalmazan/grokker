## Example Usage

Getting started, using grokker's own source code as example documents:

```
$ grok init
Initialized a new .grok file in the current directory.

$ grok add README.md cmd/grok/main.go grokker.go TODO.md

Creating .grok file... adding README.md... adding cmd/grok/main.go...
adding grokker.go... adding TODO.md... done!
```

Make a one-time query without storing chat history:

```
$ grok q "What is grokker?"

Grokker is a tool for interactive conversation with one or more
documents, used for research, training, and rapid learning. It
utilizes OpenAI API services for the backend. Essentially, you can
input documents into Grokker and it will use natural language
processing to analyze the text and help you answer questions about
those documents.
```

Same thing, but providing the question on stdin:

```
$ echo "What is the `qi` subcommand for?" | grok qi

The 'qi' subcommand allows you to ask a question by providing it on
standard input rather than passing it as a command-line argument. This
subcommand is especially useful in editor sessions and when writing
plugins -- more about this below. 
```

## Installation

``` 
go install github.com/stevegt/grokker/cmd/grok 
``` 

You'll need an account with OpenAI and an API key. You can create and
manage your API keys in your OpenAI dashboard.

Before using Grokker, you'll need to set your API key as an
environment variable in your terminal session or .bashrc with the
following command:

``` 
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> 
```


## Tell me more about the `chat` subcommand

The `chat` subcommand allows you to interact with the system's
knowledge base in a conversational manner. It accepts a `chatfile` as
a mandatory argument, which is where the chat history is stored. The
`-s` flag is optional and can be used to pass a system message, which
controls the behavior of the OpenAI API. In usage, it might look like
`grok chat chatfile -s sysmsg`, where `sysmsg` is an optional system
message, and `chatfile` is the required text file where the chat
history is stored.  There are several other optional flags that can be
used with the `chat` subcommand, such as a `-m` flag so you can
provide the prompt on the command line instead of on stdin, and `-i`
and `-o` flags to specify input and output files.  There are also
flags to control context sources.  See `grok chat -h` for more
details.

## Tell me more about the `qi` subcommand

The `qi` subcommand allows you to ask a question by providing it on
stdin. It's a way to generate quick answers to questions without
having to provide the question as a command-line argument.

The `qi` subcommand enables you to use grokker as a chat client in an
editor session by typing questions directly in your document and
receiving answers inline after the question.   

## Using grokker as a chat client in an editor session

Using Grokker as a chat client in an editor session can help you
quickly find and summarize information from a set of documents in a
local directory tree, including the documents you are editing. This
can make your development, research, or learning process more
efficient and streamlined. Additionally, having the context of your
editor session available as part of the chat history can help you
better keep track of and synthesize information as you work.

It's a quick way to build a document and was used to build this one.

Using grokker as a chat client in an editor session is also a way to
access the backend servers used by ChatGPT without being constrained
by the ChatGPT web frontend, all while maintaining your own chat
history and any additional context in your own local files,
versionable in git.  

### How can I use grokker in a VIM editor session?

To use the `qi` subcommand in a VIM editor session, you can add a
keyboard mapping to your vimrc file. Here's an example mapping:

``` 
:map <leader>g vap:!grok qi<CR> 
```

This mapping will allow you to ask a question by typing it in VIM and
then pressing `<leader>g`. The `vap` causes the current paragraph to be
hightlighted, and the `:!grok qi` causes it to be sent as input to the
`qi` subcommand of Grokker.  The answer will be inserted into the
buffer below the current paragrpah. Note that the mapping assumes that
Grokker's `grok` command is installed and in your system path.

You will get better results if you `:set autowrite` so the current
file's most recent content will be included in the question context. 

Experiment with variations on these mappings -- you might emphasize
more recent context by including the previous two paragraphs as part
of the query, or the most recent 50 lines, or the output of `git
diff`, etc.  (Future versions of grokker may help with this
by timestamping individual document chunks and prioritizing more
recent edits.)

In practice, as of this writing I either hit `<leader>g` to highlight
and use the current paragraph as the GPT query, or I use `<Shift-V>` to
highlight several paragraphs for more context, and then run
`:'<,'>!grok qi`.  Works.

## Tell me more about the `-g` flag

The `-g` flag is an optional parameter that you can include when
running the `q` subcommand. It stands for "global" and when included,
Grokker will provide answers not only from the local documents that
you've added but also from OpenAI's global knowledge base. This means
that you'll get a wider range of potentially useful answers, but it
may take longer to receive your results as the global knowledge base
is larger and may take more time to search through. If you don't
include the `-g` flag, Grokker will prefer the local documents that
you've added.

## What are the `models` and `model` subcommands?

The `models` subcommand is used to list all the available OpenAI
models for text processing in Grokker, including their name and
maximum token limit. 

The `model` subcommand is used to set the default GPT model for use in
queries.  This default is stored in the local .grok db.  (I haven't
added a flag to override this default for a single query, but this
would be doable.)

## About the words `grokker` and `grok`

The word `grok` is from Robert Heinlein's [Stranger in a Strange
Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land) --
there's a good summary of the word's meaning and history in
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok).  Roughly translated,
it means "to understand something so thoroughly that the observer
becomes a part of the observed".  

It's a popular word in science fiction and computer science and the
namespace is crowded.  

The name `grokker` is used by the company grokker.com, though the
problem domains are different.  We are not affiliated with
grokker.com.

The folks at xAI released and filed a trademark application for the
`grok` online AI tool several months after we were already using the
word in this project.  We're not affiliated with xAI, but we wish them
well.  

Jordan Sissel's log file analysis tool also uses a `grok` command.  If
you want to install grokker on the same machine, you can install it
using an alternate command name.  Here's an example of installing
grokker as `grokker` instead of `grok`:

``` 
cd /tmp 
git clone http://github.com/stevegt/grokker 
cd grokker/cmd/grok/ 
go build -o grokker 
cp grokker $GOPATH/bin 
```

## Is grokker done?  

Grokker is not done, but I use it extensively every day. See
[TODO.md](./TODO.md) for a pretty long list of wishlist and brainstorm
items.  At this time, refactoring the storage for text chunks and
embeddings is likely the most important -- that .grok file can get
pretty big. So far I haven't seen performance problems even when
grokking several dozen documents or source code files, but I want to
be able to grok an entire tree of hundreds of files without concerns.

In all of the following use cases, I'd say my own productivity has
increased by an order of magnitude -- I'm finding myself finishing
projects in days that previously would have taken weeks.  What's
really nice is that I'm finally making progress on years-old complex
projects that were previously stalled.  

### What are some use cases grokker already supports?

In all of the following use cases, I tend to create and `grok add` a
`context.md` file that I use as a scratchpad, writing and refining
questions and answers as I work on other files in the same directory
or repository. This file is my interactive, animated [rubber
duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).  This
technique has worked well.  I'm considering switching to using
something like `grok.md`, `grokker.md`, `groktext.md`, or `gpt.md` for
this filename and proposing it as a best practice.

Grokker has been a huge help in its original use case -- getting up to
speed quickly on complex topics, documents, and code bases.  It's
particularly good at translating the unique terminology that tends to
exist in specialized papers and code. The large language models
backing grokker are optimized for inferring meaning from context;
this allows them to expand terms into more general language even in
cases where the original author was unable to make that difficult
leap.

I've been pleasantly surprised by how much grokker has also helped
translate my own ideas into documents and code.  I can describe things
in my own terms in one or more files, and just as with others' works,
the language models do a better job than I can of translating my
terminology into more-general human language and executable code.  

Another useful technique I've found is to prompt the model to ask me
questions about a concept I'm having trouble getting out of my own
head into text; I then ask the model to answer its own questions, then
I manually edit the answers to reflect what I'm actually thinking.
This clears writer's block, reduces my own typing workload by moving
me into the role of editor, and helps to more quickly detect and
resolve uncertainties.  Because grokker will include my edited text as
context in future model queries, this provides feedback to the model,
causing future answers to converge toward my intent.  (See
[RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback)
for one possible way of formalizing this.)

# Important disclaimer regarding sensitive and confidential information

Using OpenAI's API services to analyze documents means that any
document you `grok add`, and any question you ask of grokker, will be
broken into chunks and sent to OpenAI's servers twice -- first to
generate context embedding vectors, and again as relevant context when
you run `grok q` or `grok qi`.

If any of your document's content is sensitive or confidential, you'll
want to review OpenAI's policies regarding data usage and retention.

Additionally, some topics are banned by OpenAI's policies, so be sure
to review and comply with their guidelines in order to prevent your
API access being suspended or revoked. 

As always, it's a good idea to review the terms and conditions of any
API service you're considering using to ensure that you're comfortable
with how your data will be handled.
